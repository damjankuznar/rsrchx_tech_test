Rsrchx Tech Test

## Running the application



## Tech Test Requirements
Build a command line app for a food delivery service. The customer user interface should
present the user with the ability to:

1. List foods
2. Pick a food and read more about it
3. Add one or more food items to a cart
4. View cart
5. Checkout (assume payment goes through)
6. View order details

**The food delivery service user will be able to:**
1. See pending orders
2. Mark order as delivered to clear it off the list

When the food delivery service user marks an order as delivered, the customer user should see
that reflected on his order details.
The command line app should talk to a backend via a REST API. You can use any frameworks
of your choice, but please stick to python for language choice.

**What would we assess:**
1. Data model design
2. Bug free execution
3. Test coverage
4. REST API design
5. Separation of concerns
6. Easy to follow instructions to test and execute

**What we donâ€™t expect to see:**
1. A full fledged Auth framework
2. Session Management
3. Any other production-grade software concerns like performance, monitoring, security,
containerisation etc.
